## Welcome to NERRF
NERRF is an open-source project exploring AI-driven "undo computing" for post-zero-trust cloud and IoT environments. This MVP implements a fine-grained rollback system using eBPF instrumentation, Graph Neural Networks (GNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, and Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to reverse ransomware attacks (e.g., LockBit-style) on Kubernetes clusters. Aimed at reducing Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) < 60 min and data loss < 128 MB, NERRF targets security researchers, cloud engineers, and AI practitioners. it offers a scalable, reproducible framework with Helm deployment and synthetic datasets!!


## Getting Started

###  I Want to Deploy It

Start with the **[Tracker Quick Start](./tracker/quick-start)** to get eBPF tracing running in 5 minutes.

```bash
cd tracker && make tracker && sudo ./bin/tracker
```

### I Want to Understand It

Read **[System Architecture](./architecture)** for a complete overview of components and threat model.

### I Want to Contribute

Check **[Implementation Guide](./tracker/implementation)** for deep dives into kernel code and design patterns.

### I Want to Test the Attack

Follow **[Threat Model & LockBit Scenario](./threat-model)** to run ransomware simulations on your cluster.
